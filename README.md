# Stuf and Things
Let me tell you a story. Maybe it won't be the craziest 
story ever, but I don't care. It all begins with one of
the most disrupting events of the century and a certain
someone being bored when taking an introductory C class 
(this was his third or fourth year coding in C). So, 
like the sensible person that is is, he decided to work
on a new project. But what to pick... He already spent
sometime working with really nasty things like modifying
return pointers as to skip lines of code. He even wrote
a fizzbuzz program that involved a lot of Gaussian 
Elimination and a handmade synthetic arithmetic engine
to solve string-interpolating functions that could be
evaluated later to reproduce any string desired. After
these, he wanted to take a small break. And so, he 
decided to dissect the inner workings of a wav file and
write a basic tone generator for wav files.

Now, you must be thinking how it could ever be that 
this code is called simple. It isn't the most complex,
but neither is it all that simple. It even involves an
entire set of semantics! And you would be right! This 
is version two of a much more simple program written 
around two years prior. It had a much more painful and 
popping sound generation than this current version, 
and writing music for it was incredibly complex. It
wasn't worth the effort of writing anything more than
just the original theme to Mario. Yet funnily enough,
that really simple bit of code had come back time and
time again in my life. Every time I thought I had rid
myself of those 80 some lines of code, someone would
say that the music would randomly come on when listening
to music. Finally, it was decided that enough was 
enough, over a cup of chai tea and an acai bowl, that
two computer nerds would spend a little more time
at making a nicer, more cared for generator with
a much greater versatility. 

So here we are. Again, nothing crazy. Just a simple 
project about 2 years in the making that was never
meant to be anything. For more info, look into the 
stuf directory. That's where the program will look 
for files to turn into wav.
